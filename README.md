# Find-the-Best-Movie
My project to teach myself how to do web scraping
In this project, I use various Python library such as Panda and Beautiful soup to collect critics rating and viewers rating from Rotten Tomato.
I then use glob to pull review from roger ebert website and movies' poster from either wikipedia or google to construc a data frame for 100 best movies rated by Rotten Tomata.
